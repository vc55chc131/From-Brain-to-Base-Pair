# üß† From Brain to Base Pair: Transcriptomic Analysis of Language Control

This repository provides all necessary materials for reproducing the transcriptomic analysis presented in our study:  
**"From Brain to Base Pair: A Dual-Site Transcriptomic Analysis of Language Control in Simultaneous Interpreting."**

The project links functional neuroimaging findings with molecular neuroscience by comparing gene expression profiles between the **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** and **caudate nucleus**, two regions critical to simultaneous interpreting cognition.

## üîç Related Work in Progress

This project is part of a larger research program integrating **neuroimaging**, **transcriptomics**, and **translation studies**, with upcoming publications including:

- Interpreter Genomics I (current manuscript)
- Interpreter Genomics II (in preparation; DLPFC-focused meta-synthesis of gene variants)

- ### Input Example
The script expects a file named `AHBA_expression_matrix.csv` with the following structure:

| GeneID | 1001 | 1002 | 2001 | 2002 |
|--------|------|------|------|------|
| ABC1   | 1.23 | 2.45 | 0.98 | 1.76 |

Sample IDs prefixed with "1xxx" are DLPFC, "2xxx" are caudate samples.
