This repository contains the full reproducible codebase, analytic pipeline, and documentation used in the study. The study integrates fMRI-derived regions of interest (ROIs) with postmortem gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) to investigate the neurogenomic architecture underlying simultaneous interpreting (SI).
