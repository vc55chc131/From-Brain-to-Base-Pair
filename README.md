# ðŸ§  From Brain to Base Pair: Transcriptomic Analysis of Language Control

This repository provides all necessary materials for reproducing the transcriptomic analysis presented in our study:  
**"From Brain to Base Pair: A Dual-Site Transcriptomic Analysis of Language Control in Simultaneous Interpreting."**

The project links functional neuroimaging findings with molecular neuroscience by comparing gene expression profiles between the **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** and **caudate nucleus**, two regions critical to simultaneous interpreting cognition.

All analysis scripts used to generate the results and figures in this paper are fully available in the `source_code/` directory of this repository.
